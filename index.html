<h1>Stuff I say.</h1>
<p>
  Earlier, you could find me doing a lot of
  &lt;Rant about javascript which sucks compared to as3/&gt;.
</p>
<p>
  These days however, with the upcoming of html5 and lot's of
  projects further, that belief has grown much stronger. For
  complex architecture and applications above 50kloc, you really,
  really don't want to involve a compatibility layer in your application.
  And that's what all javascript frameworks are.<br/>
  compatibility layers.
